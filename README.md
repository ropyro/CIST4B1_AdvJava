# CIST4B1_AdvJava
> A repository to document my Java learning journey; exploring Data Structures and Algorithms in more depth. 

## About Me
  - My name is Ronin Richman and I am a second year student at WVC.
  - Although it is a tough uphill battle, I love learning to code.
  - In my freetime I bake lots of bread & go on hikes with my loved ones.
## Goals for This Course
  - Get over my fear of linked lists & trees
  - Learn more algorithms to help with Leetcode
  - Write better unit tests
## In-Class Java Coding Warm Up file
  - I joined the class a bit late, I am assuming this is from week one.
  I will talk with Professor Calle the next class to see if I can make this up.
