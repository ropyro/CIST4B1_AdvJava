# Playing Catch Up

> Unfortunately the first week of this semester I was unable to join this class as I was waiting for my prerequisite clearance form to be filed.
> In spite of this set back, I perserved through many emails, phone calls, and wait lists to get into this class. Come Wednesday, I plan on staying
> after class to ask Professor Calle for a recap or recordings of the first couple classes.

> From my understanding during week2's Monday class, the first week was mostly review of Java syntax and OOP as a whole. These concepts still feel
> sharp in my mind, however I know better than to blindly trust these feelings. I must do some review if I want to feel fully prepared.

> Normal arrays are a data structure I do not use frequently in my Minecraft projects. I always default to using the ArrayList util class. Some of
> the core functionality and theory behind arrays has been lost in my mind. I have allowed the helper methods in ArrayList to make me kind of lazy
> in my thought process behind arrays. This focus has already helped me see holes in my understanding and taught me some new and exciting concepts.
