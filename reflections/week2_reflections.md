# Branching off

As we continued reviewing, this problem of recursion was an incredible focus. A concept that I thought I still remembered
well actually felt quite foreign. On the surface calling a method from within itself was still in my mind, but the logic
behind designing an algorithm using this technique took me longer to figure out than I was anticipating.

After spending some time fiddling with the maze solver problem, I was able to figure out a solution, but to a certain extent
it still felt magical that it works. The cases where a dead end is found feel tricky to wrap my mind around why the resetting
of the point to unvisited, works for back tracking. Ultimately this practice was super helpful.

Along with the coding exercise, the discussion post forced me to think of recursive in a more abstract way. Describing an 
everyday activity recursively helped me better formulate my thinking for how problems can be solved recursively. I kept having
to rewrite my post because half-way through I would realize my approach was still iteration versus recursion. It finally clicked
when I reread the directions to break the problem down into a smaller version of itself. Not a series of small problems, just one
step down from where it is currently until the base case is reached.
